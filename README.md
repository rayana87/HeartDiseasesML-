# HeartDiseasesML-
Implementation of Heart diseases using Machine Learning

Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world including the healthcare industry, Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting of Heart diseases and more. Such information can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.Some application areas in which ML techniques are used includes Banking, Fraud detection, Bio-informatics, Marketing, Insurance, and Healthcare.

Our topic is about prediction of heart disease by processing patients' dataset to whom we need to predict the chance of occurrence of a heart disease. 

#### This notebook contains four algorithms of ML, as follow:  
* K Neighbors Classifier -->  looks for the classes of K nearest neighbors of a given data point and based on the majority class, it assigns a class to this data point.
* Support Vector Classifier --> form a hyperplane that can separate the classes as much as possible by adjusting the distance between the data points
* Decision Tree Classifier --> creates a decision tree, it assigns the class values to each data point.
* Random Forest Classifier --> Similar to Decision Trees. It creates a forest of trees where each tree is formed by a random selection of features from the total features
